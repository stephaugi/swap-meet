# Coworking Agreement

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.

## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*
We both need to be able to meet online over zoom, slack huddle or coworking time. We need to coordinate between timezones. Time during lunch break or an hour after classes work as coworking time.

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*
We'd like to try to do some pair coding and also working independently.


## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*
Ekaterina: I usually start by reading the README to understand the project’s purpose and requirements, then review the main code, tests etc. I like to note the requirements as comments in the functions I plan to write and clearly define the inputs and outputs first.

Stephanie: I prefer to look at the project overview, also breaking down into a plan or steps and then researching different methods to approach those steps.

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*
Ekaterina: I prefer to receive feedback after I’ve finished or implemented something, rather than during the process. If there are several points to cover, I’d like to discuss them all at once. I value the chance to learn from my own mistakes, and getting feedback afterward gives me the opportunity to discover and reflect before making improvements.

Stephanie: I prefer feedback where we discuss approaches and thinking behind a process and then weighing pros and cons between using a different method that might be more efficient/appropriate.


## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*
We’d like to improve how we talk about and explain our code to others, including breaking down tasks and sharing them when pairing. We also want to get better at giving and receiving feedback, practice active listening to make sure everyone feels heard, and strengthen our skills in estimating time, planning sprints or tasks, and resolving disagreements constructively.

## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*
To be respectful of each other’s time and maintain a healthy work–life balance. We’ll give advance notice if we need to adjust our co-working schedule and be mindful of breaks so we can stay focused and productive. We'll try to schedule in time but if something comes up, we'll trust each other to communicate and manage the project.
